        <p>We took a fishing trip out to this lovely campground. There were quite some large fish out there, I doubt you'd belive how big they were.</p>

        <p>We didn't have many people to go on this trip, but Briar Junction was a nice calm campground. We're hoping to bring more people next trip.</p>
